# TESTING

This project contains a file called `testing.sh` to run this file correctly please
first make sure that the url at the top of the file matches the one you use to run
the server on (port also needs to match!)

-   First you need to start up the python server `python app.py`
-   Then create a new terminal tab and run `sh testing.sh` to start the tests, the
    program will tell you the tests pass/fail.
